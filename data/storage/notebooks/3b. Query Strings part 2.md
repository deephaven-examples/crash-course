# Deephaven's query strings (Part 2)

The previous notebook discussed query strings in Deephaven. It covered usage, syntax, literals, special variables and constants, and Java in query strings. This notebook takes a deeper look at Python in query strings as well as arrays in query strings.

## Python in query strings

Python objects can be used in query strings. Variables are the simplest case.

```python
a = 1
b = 2

add_vars = empty_table(1).update("Sum = a + b")
```

Python functions can also be used.

```python
def my_sum(x, y):
    return x + y


a = 1
b = 2

add_vars_func = empty_table(1).update(["Sum1 = my_sum(1, 2)", "Sum2 = my_sum(a, b)"])
```

So can classes.

```python
class MyMathClass:

    def __init__(self, x):
        self.x = x

    def sum(self, y):
        return self.x + y

    @classmethod
    def class_sum(self, x, y):
        return x + y

    @staticmethod
    def static_sum(x, y):
        return x + y


a = 1
b = 2
class_instance = MyMathClass(a)

add_vars_class = empty_table(1).update(
    [
        "Sum1 = class_instance.sum(b)",
        "Sum2 = MyMathClass.class_sum(a, b)",
        "Sum3 = MyMathClass.static_sum(a, b)",
    ]
)
```

Without any typecasts or [type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html), the Deephaven query engine cannot infer what datatype results from a Python function. It stores the result as a Java [PyObject](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/how-to-guides/pyobjects/#what-is-a-pyobject) or [Object](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html).

```python
add_vars_meta = add_vars.meta_table
add_vars_func_meta = add_vars_func.meta_table
add_vars_class_meta = add_vars_class.meta_table
```

This isn't ideal, as neither of these data types support many of the DQL features we've covered. To rectify this, Python functions should utilize [type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html). The engine will be able to infer the correct column types for functions that use type hints. Class methods don't support type hints yet, so a typecast in the query string is required.

```python
from deephaven import empty_table


def my_sum(x, y) -> int:
    return x + y


class MyMathClass:

    def __init__(self, x):
        self.x = x

    def sum(self, y) -> int:
        return self.x + y

    @classmethod
    def class_sum(self, x, y) -> int:
        return x + y

    @staticmethod
    def static_sum(x, y) -> int:
        return x + y


a = 1
b = 2
class_instance = MyMathClass(a)

add_vars_func = empty_table(1).update(["Sum1 = my_sum(1, 2)", "Sum2 = my_sum(a, b)"])

# Note the (int) casts
add_vars_class = empty_table(1).update(
    [
        "Sum1 = (int) class_instance.sum(b)",
        "Sum2 = (int) MyMathClass.class_sum(a, b)",
        "Sum3 = (int) MyMathClass.static_sum(a, b)",
    ]
)

add_vars_func_meta = add_vars_func.meta_table
add_vars_class_meta = add_vars_class.meta_table
```

To learn more about using Python in query strings, see the user guides on [functions](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/how-to-guides/simple-python-function/) and [classes](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/how-to-guides/python-classes/).

Scoping in Deephaven follows Python's [LEGB](https://realpython.com/python-scope-legb-rule/) scoping rules. Functions that return tables or otherwise make use of query strings should pay careful attention to scoping details.

```python
def f(a, b) -> int:
    return a * b


def compute(source, a):
    return source.update("X = f(a, A)")


source = empty_table(5).update("A = i")

result1 = compute(source, 10)
result2 = compute(source, 3)
```

For more information, see the [scoping user guide](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/query-language/variables/query-scope/#encapsulated-query-logic-in-functions).

Be mindful of whether or not Python functions are stateless or stateful. Generally, stateless functions have no side effects - they don't modify any objects outside of their scope. Also, they are invariant to execution order, so function calls can be evaluated in any order without affecting the result. This stateless function extracts elements from a list in a query string.

```python
my_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]


def get_element_stateless(idx) -> int:
    return my_list[idx]


t_stateless = empty_table(10).update("X = get_element_stateless(ii)")
```

`get_element` is stateless because it does not modify any objects outside of its local scope. It could be evaluated at any order and give the same result.

Stateful functions modify objects outside of their local scope - they do not leave the world as they found it. They also may depend on execution order. This stateful function achieves the same resulting table.

```python
my_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
idx = 0


def get_element_stateful() -> int:
    global idx
    idx += 1  # This modifies idx!
    return my_list[idx - 1]


t_stateful = empty_table(10).update("X = get_element_stateful()")
```

Print `idx` to verify it's been changed.

```python
print(idx)
```

Now that `get_element` is stateful, it must be evaluated in the correct order to give the correct result.

Queries should use stateful functions whenever possible because:

- They minimize side effects when called.
- They are deterministic.
- They can be efficiently parallelized.
