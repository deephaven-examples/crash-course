# Table operations (part 1)

This notebook will cover some table operations that appear in almost all queries. It is the first of two notebooks that cover table operations. These tables operations use query strings extensively, which are discussed in detail in later notebooks.

Table operations are integral to the Deephaven Query Language (DQL). The previous notebook used three:

- [`update_view`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/table-operations/select/update-view/), which adds columns to or modifies existing columns in a table.
- [`tail`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/table-operations/filter/tail/), which keeps the last `n` rows of a table.
- [`reverse`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/table-operations/sort/reverse/), which reverses the order of rows in a table.

These three operations are only a small part of Deephaven's table API. This notebook and the next cover a wide range of table operations.

Many of the code blocks in this notebook use the following table, `t`, as the root table. This is a simple [`time_table`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/how-to-guides/time-table/) that updates with one new row per second and contains only a `Timestamp` column.

```python
from deephaven import time_table

t = time_table("PT1s")
```

## Basic column manipulation

### Add and modify columns

[`update`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/table-operations/select/update/) creates *in-memory* columns. An in-memory column is one where the calculations are performed immediately, and results are stored in memory. The following code block adds three columns to `t`.

- `IntRowIndex`: 32-bit integer row indices.
- `LongRowIndex`: 64-bit integer row indices.
- `Group`: modulo of `IntRowIndex` and 5.

```python
t_updated = t.update(["IntRowIndex = i", "LongRowIndex = ii", "Group = IntRowIndex % 5"])
```

[`update_view`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/table-operations/select/update-view/) creates *formula* columns. A formula column is one where only the formula is stored in memory when called. Results are then computed on the fly as needed. [`update_view`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/table-operations/select/update-view/) is best used when calculations are simple or when only small subsets of the data are used.

The following code block adds two new columns to `t`.

- `IntRowIndex`: 32-bit integer row indices.
- `Group`: modulo of `IntRowIndex` and 5.

```python
t_update_viewed = t.update_view(["IntRowIndex = i", "Group = IntRowIndex % 5"])
```

[`lazy_update`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/table-operations/select/lazy-update/) creates *memoized* columns.  A memoized column performs calculations immediately and stores them in memory, but a calculation is only performed and stored once for each unique set of input values.

The following code block adds two new columns to `t_updated`.

- `GroupSqrt`: square root of `Group`.
- `GroupSquared`: square of `Group`.

Because `Group` has only five unique values, only 10 calculations are needed to populate the two new columns.

```python
t_lazy_updated = t_updated.lazy_update(["GroupSqrt = sqrt(Group)", "GroupSquared = Group * Group"])
```

### Select columns

[`select`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/table-operations/select/select/) and [`view`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/table-operations/select/view/) both create tables containing subsets of input columns and new columns computed from input columns.  The big difference between the methods is how much memory they allocate and when formulas are evaluated.  Performance and memory considerations dictate the best method for a particular use case.

[`select`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/table-operations/select/select/), like [`update`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/table-operations/select/update/), creates *in-memory* columns. The following code block selects two existing columns from `t_updated` and adds a new column.

```python
t_selected = t_updated.select(["Timestamp", "IntRowIndex", "RowPlusOne = IntRowIndex + 1"])
```

[`view`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/table-operations/select/view/), like [`update_view`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/table-operations/select/update-view/), creates *formula* columns. The following code block selects two existing columns from `t_updated` and adds a new column.

```python
t_viewed = t_updated.view(["Timestamp", "LongRowIndex", "RowPlusOne = LongRowIndex + 1"])
```

### Drop columns

[`drop_columns`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/table-operations/select/drop-columns/) removes columns from a table.

```python
t_dropped = t_updated.drop_columns(["IntRowIndex", "LongRowIndex"])
```

Alternatively, [`view`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/table-operations/select/view/) and [`select`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/table-operations/select/) can be used remove columns by omission. Both tables created below drop `IntRowIndex` and `LongRowIndex` by not including them in the list of columns passed in.

```python
t_dropped_via_view = t_updated.view(["Timestamp", "Group"])
t_dropped_via_select = t_updated.select(["Timestamp", "Group"])
```

## Filter

### By condition

[`where`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/table-operations/filter/where/) filters rows from a table based on a condition. The following code block keeps only rows in `t_updated` where `IntRowIndex` is an even number.

```python
t_filtered = t_updated.where("IntRowIndex % 2 == 0")
```

Multiple filters can be applied in a single statement.

```python
t_filtered_2 = t_updated.where(["Group == 3", "IntRowIndex % 2 == 0"])
```

A [`where`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/table-operations/filter/where/) operation that applies multiple conditions keeps only data that meets *all* of the criteria set forth. To keep rows that meet *one or more* of the specified criteria, use [`where_one_of`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/table-operations/filter/where-one-of/).

```python
t_filtered_3 = t_updated.where_one_of(["Group == 3", "IntRowIndex % 2 == 0"])
```

In addition to [`where`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/table-operations/filter/where/) and [`where_one_of`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/table-operations/filter/where-one-of/), Deephaven offers [`where_in`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/table-operations/filter/where-in/) and [`where_not_in`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/table-operations/filter/where-not-in/), which filter table data based on another table.

See the [filtering guide](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/how-to-guides/use-filters/) for more information.

### By row position

Methods that filter data by row position only keep a portion of data at the top, middle, or bottom of a table.

- [`head`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/table-operations/filter/head/): Keep the first `n` rows.
- [`head_pct`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/table-operations/filter/head-pct/): Keep the first `n%` of rows.
- [`tail`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/table-operations/filter/tail/): Keep the last `n` rows.
- [`tail_pct`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/table-operations/filter/tail-pct/): Keep the last `n%` of rows.
- [`slice`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/table-operations/filter/slice/): Keep rows between `start` and `end`.
- [`slice_pct`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/table-operations/filter/slice-pct/): Keep rows between `start%` and `end%`.

```python
from deephaven import empty_table


t_static = empty_table(100).update(["X = randomInt(0, 100)", "Y = randomDouble(10, 25)"])

# 10 rows at the top
t_head = t_static.head(10)

# 10% of rows at the top
t_head_pct = t_static.head_pct(0.1)

# 15 rows at the bottom
t_tail = t_static.tail(15)

# 15% of rows at the bottom
t_tail_pct = t_static.tail_pct(0.15)

# 20 rows in the middle
t_slice = t_static.slice(40, 60)

# 20% of rows in the middle
t_slice_pct = t_static.slice_pct(0.4, 0.6)
```

See the [filtering guide](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/how-to-guides/use-filters/) for more information.

## Sort

The [`sort`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/table-operations/sort/sort/) method sorts a table based on one or more columns. The following code block sorts `t_static` by `X` in ascending order.

```python
t_sorted = t_static.sort("X")
```

Tables can be sorted by more than one column.

```python
t_sorted_multiple = t_static.sort(["X", "Y"])
```

To sort in descending order, use [`sort_descending`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/table-operations/sort/sort-descending/).

```python
t_sorted_desc = t_static.sort_descending("X")
```

To sort in multiple columns in different directions, use [`sort`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/table-operations/sort/sort/) with a [`SortDirection`](https://deephaven.io/core/pydoc/code/deephaven.html#deephaven.SortDirectionhttps://deephaven.io/core/pydoc/code/deephaven.html#deephaven.SortDirection) for each column.

```python
from deephaven import SortDirection

t_sort_multi = t_static.sort(["X", "Y"], [SortDirection.ASCENDING, SortDirection.DESCENDING])
```

See our [sorting guide](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/how-to-guides/sort/) for more information.

## Continue the crash course

The next notebook, [Table Operations, Part 2](./2b.%20Table%20Operations%20part%202.md), covers more table operations. It covers grouping, aggregating, and joining tables.
