# Powerful Python integrations

Deephaven empowers Python developers by providing efficient integrations with popular Python libraries. This section covers some highlights of Deephaven's Python interoperability as well as the inherent limitations of static Python data structures.

## Pandas

The [`deephaven.pandas`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/how-to-guides/use-pandas/) module is the gateway to [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) interoperability. The module itself is simple, containing only two functions: [`to_pandas`](https://deephaven.io/core/pydoc/code/deephaven.pandas.html#deephaven.pandas.to_pandas), which converts a Deephaven table into a [Pandas DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/frame.html), and [`to_table`](https://deephaven.io/core/pydoc/code/deephaven.pandas.html#deephaven.pandas.to_table), which converts a [Pandas DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/frame.html) into a Deephaven table.

```python
from deephaven import pandas as dhpd
from deephaven import empty_table

t = empty_table(10).update(
    [
        "Timestamp = '2015-01-01T00:00:00 ET' + 'PT1m'.multipliedBy(ii)",
        "Group = randomInt(1, 4)",
        "GroupMean = Group == 1 ? -10.0 : Group == 2 ? 0.0 : Group == 3 ? 10.0 : NULL_DOUBLE",
        "GroupStd = Group == 1 ? 2.5 : Group == 2 ? 0.5 : Group == 3 ? 1.0 : NULL_DOUBLE",
        "X = randomGaussian(GroupMean, GroupStd)",
    ]
)

t_df = dhpd.to_pandas(t)
```

The appropriate column types are automatically inferred.

```python
print(t_df.dtypes)
```

Pandas operations can be applied to the DataFrame and the result can be converted back to a Deephaven table.

```python
t_df_group_avg = t_df.groupby("Group").mean()
t_group_avg = dhpd.to_table(t_df_group_avg)
```

Doing this in a Deephaven table would be more efficient, but this example demonstrates the flexibility of the Pandas integration.

Note that Pandas DataFrames are inherently static. Converting a ticking Deephaven table to a Pandas DataFrame snapshots the table at that moment in time.

## NumPy

[NumPy](https://numpy.org/) is one of Python's most popular packages. It implements arrays and array operations. Deephaven's [`deephaven.numpy`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/how-to-guides/use-numpy/) package, like the Pandas package, contains only two functions, [`to_numpy`](https://deephaven.io/core/pydoc/code/deephaven.numpy.html#deephaven.numpy.to_numpy) and [`to_table`](https://deephaven.io/core/pydoc/code/deephaven.numpy.html#deephaven.numpy.to_numpy), for converting to and from NumPy arrays and Deephaven tables, respectively.

```python
from deephaven import numpy as dhnp
from deephaven import empty_table

t = empty_table(10).update(["X = ii", "Y = X + 2", "Z = sin(X + Y)"])

t_np = dhnp.to_numpy(t.view(["X = (double)X", "Z"]))
print(t_np)

t_np_transposed = t_np.transpose()
print(t_np_transposed)

col_names = [
    "Col1",
    "Col2",
    "Col3",
    "Col4",
    "Col5",
    "Col6",
    "Col7",
    "Col8",
    "Col9",
    "Col10",
]
t_transposed = dhnp.to_table(t_np_transposed, col_names)
```

Note: in this example, the `X` column is cast from a `long` to a `double`. NumPy arrays can only contain a single data type, while Deephaven tables can contain one data type per column. To create a NumPy array, all columns must be the same type. For example, the following conversion will fail.

```python
t = empty_table(10).update(["X = ii", "Y = sin(X)", "Z = Y > 0 ? 1 : 0"])

# This will fail - a NumPy array can't have more than one data type!
t_np = dhnp.to_numpy(t)
```

## The `deephaven.learn` library

> **_NOTE:_** This section uses [SciKit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/). This Deephaven instance does not come pre-configured with the package. The following code block installs it.

```python
import os
# Install SciKit-Learn. This does nothing if it's already installed.
os.system("pip install scikit-learn")
```

See [install Python packages](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/how-to-guides/install-and-use-python-packages/) for best practices when installing Python packages in Deephaven.

Aimed at ML/AI practitioners, [`deephaven.learn`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/how-to-guides/use-deephaven-learn/) provides a general-purpose framework for efficient data interchange between Deephaven tables and Python objects such as NumPy arrays, Torch tensors, and more. [`deephaven.learn`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/how-to-guides/use-deephaven-learn/) is fundamentally geared towards machine learning applications, as it enables models to be applied to real-time data.

[`deephaven.learn`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/how-to-guides/use-deephaven-learn/) utilizes a gather-compute-scatter framework:

- Data is gathered from a table into a Python object.
- A model is applied to the object, possibly producing outputs.
- The results are scattered back into the table.

> **_NOTE:_** `deephaven.learn` currently only works on append-only tables.

A simple and effective example of machine learning in Deephaven is Iris flower classification. It's an effective introductory problem in machine learning. The objective is to build a model that accurately predicts the class of Iris flower based on four measurements. This notebook will do so with a K-nearest neighbors model.

```python
from deephaven import read_csv
import numpy as np

iris = read_csv("/data/Iris/iris.csv")

classes = {}
num_classes = 0


def get_class_number(c) -> np.intc:
    global classes, num_classes
    if c not in classes:
        classes[c] = num_classes
        num_classes += 1
    return classes[c]


iris = iris.update(formulas=["Class = get_class_number(Class)"])
```

### Gather

To gather table data into Python, use `deephaven.learn.gather.table_to_numpy_2d`. The following code block calls it in two functions: one for doubles, the other for ints. These will both be used shortly.

```python
from deephaven.learn import gather


# "gather" functions for double and 32-bit int data types
def table_to_numpy_double(rows, columns):
    return gather.table_to_numpy_2d(rows, columns, np_type=np.double)


def table_to_numpy_int(rows, columns):
    return gather.table_to_numpy_2d(rows, columns, np_type=np.intc)
```

### Compute

Machine learning applies models to data. Models typically produce no outputs when training, but do produce outputs when applied after training is complete. The following code block defines two functions. The first trains a K-nearest neighbors model on data, and the second applies the trained model. They will be used shortly.

```python
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

model = None


def fit_knn(x_train, y_train):
    global model
    model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)
    model.fit(x_train, y_train.squeeze())


def use_knn(features):
    if features.ndim == 1:
        features = np.expand_dims(features, 0)
    predictions = np.zeros(len(features))
    for i in range(0, len(features)):
        predictions[i] = model.predict([features[i]]).squeeze()
    return predictions
```

### Scatter

In this case, scattering Python data back into a table is simple. Since the model produces scalar outputs, a scatter function only needs to return the output at the correct index.

```python
def numpy_to_table(data, idx):
    return int(data[idx])
```

### Put it all together

The `deephaven.learn.learn` function is the final piece of the puzzle. It takes the table, model function, and gather/scatter functions to both train the model as well as apply it to the table data.

First, train the model. Because this is a supervised learning model, two inputs are required: the features and the class labels. The training phase produces no outputs, so none are given.

```python
from deephaven import learn

learn.learn(
    table=iris,
    model_func=fit_knn,
    inputs=[
        learn.Input(
            ["SepalLengthCM", "SepalWidthCM", "PetalLengthCM", "PetalWidthCM"],
            table_to_numpy_double,
        ),
        learn.Input("Class", table_to_numpy_int),
    ],
    outputs=None,
    batch_size=150,
)
```

With the trained model in hand, apply it to the table data. This time, an output is produced.

```python
iris_knn_classified = learn.learn(
    table=iris,
    model_func=use_knn,
    inputs=[
        learn.Input(
            ["SepalLengthCM", "SepalWidthCM", "PetalLengthCM", "PetalWidthCM"],
            table_to_numpy_double,
        )
    ],
    outputs=[learn.Output("ClassifiedClass", numpy_to_table, "int")],
    batch_size=150,
)
```
