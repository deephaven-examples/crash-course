# Create tables

## Static tables

The simplest way to create static tables from scratch is with the [`new_table`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/table-operations/create/newTable/) and [`empty_table`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/table-operations/create/emptyTable/) methods.

```python
from deephaven import new_table, empty_table
from deephaven.column import int_col, long_col, double_col

static_table1 = new_table(
    [
        int_col("IntColumn", [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]),
        long_col("LongColumn", [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]),
        double_col("DoubleColumn", [0.12345, 2.12345, 4.12345, 6.12345, 8.12345]),
    ]
)

static_table2 = empty_table(5).update_view(
    [
        "IntColumn = i",
        "LongColumn = ii",
        "DoubleColumn = IntColumn + LongColumn + 0.12345",
    ]
)
```

> **_NOTE:_** The variables `i` and `ii` correspond to `int` and `long` row indices, respectively. They are only supported in [append-only tables](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/conceptual/table-types/#append-only).

The two tables look identical but are created differently.

- [`new_table`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/table-operations/create/newTable/) builds a table directly from column type specifications and raw data.
- [`empty_table`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/table-operations/create/emptyTable/) builds an empty table with no columns and a specified number of rows. The Deephaven Query Language (DQL) can add new columns programmatically.

## Ticking tables

You can create ticking tables to get a feel for live data in Deephaven. The [`time_table`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/how-to-guides/time-table/) method works similarly to [`empty_table`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/table-operations/create/emptyTable/) in that DQL is used to populate the table with more data. It creates a table with just a `Timestamp` column. The resultant table ticks at a regular interval specified by the input argument.

```python
from deephaven import time_table

ticking_table = time_table("PT1s")
```

The `PT1s` argument is an [ISO-8641 formatted duration string](https://www.digi.com/resources/documentation/digidocs/90001488-13/reference/r_iso_8601_duration_format.htm) that indicates the table will tick once every second.

New ticking tables can be derived from existing ones using DQL, just as in the static case.

```python
new_ticking_table = ticking_table.update_view(
    "TimestampPlusOneSecond = Timestamp + 'PT1s'"
)
```

This exemplifies Deephaven's use of the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). The table `ticking_table` is a root node in the DAG, and `new_ticking_table` is a downstream node. Because the source table is ticking, the new table is also ticking. Every update to `ticking_table` propagates down the DAG to `new_ticking_table`, and the compute-on-deltas model ensures that only the updated rows are re-evaluated with each update cycle.

## Ingesting static data

Deephaven supports reading from various common file formats like [CSV](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/data-import-export/CSV/readCsv/), [Parquet](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/data-import-export/Parquet/readTable/), and [Arrow](https://deephaven.io/core/pydoc/code/deephaven.arrow.html#module-deephaven.arrow). The following code block reads data from a local CSV file directly into a table.

```python
from deephaven import read_csv

iris = read_csv("/data/Iris/iris.csv")
```

## Real-world ticking data

Real-time data is Deephaven's mission statement. One of the easiest ways to work with realistic ticking data is by using the [`TableReplayer`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/table-operations/create/Replayer/) to replay the static data. Use it to replay the data ingested above:

```python test-set=3 order=null
from deephaven.replay import TableReplayer

replayer = TableReplayer("2023-02-09T12:09:18 ET", "2023-02-09T12:58:09 ET")
replayed_crypto = replayer.add_table(
    crypto.sort("Timestamp"), "Timestamp"
).sort_descending("Timestamp")
replayer.start()
```

Most real-world use cases for ticking data involve connecting to data streams that are constantly being updated. For this, Deephaven's [Apache Kafka integration](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/how-to-guides/data-import-export/kafka-stream/) is first-in-class, and almost any imaginable real-time streaming source can be wrangled with the [`TablePublisher`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/how-to-guides/table-publisher/) or [`DynamicTableWriter`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/how-to-guides/dynamic-table-writer/). That said, setting up the pipelines for Kafka streams or other real-time data sources can be very complex, and is outside the scope of this guide.

## Continue the crash course

The next notebook in the crash course, [Table Operations](./2.%20Table%20Operations.md), is the first of two that cover table operations, which are the bread and butter of data manipulation in Deephaven.
