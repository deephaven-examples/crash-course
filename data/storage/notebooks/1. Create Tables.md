# Create tables

## Static tables

The simplest way to create static tables from scratch is with the [`new_table`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/table-operations/create/newTable/) and [`empty_table`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/table-operations/create/emptyTable/) methods.

```python
from deephaven import new_table, empty_table
from deephaven.column import int_col, long_col, double_col

static_table1 = new_table(
    [
        int_col("IntColumn", [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]),
        long_col("LongColumn", [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]),
        double_col("DoubleColumn", [0.12345, 2.12345, 4.12345, 6.12345, 8.12345]),
    ]
)

static_table2 = empty_table(5).update_view(
    [
        "IntColumn = i",
        "LongColumn = ii",
        "DoubleColumn = IntColumn + LongColumn + 0.12345",
    ]
)
```

> **_NOTE:_** The variables `i` and `ii` correspond to `int` and `long` row indices, respectively. They are only supported in [append-only tables](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/conceptual/table-types/#append-only).

The two tables look identical but are created differently.

- [`new_table`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/table-operations/create/newTable/) builds a table directly from column type specifications and raw data.
- [`empty_table`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/table-operations/create/emptyTable/) builds an empty table with no columns and a specified number of rows. The Deephaven Query Language (DQL) can add new columns programmatically.

## Ticking tables

You can create ticking tables to get a feel for live data in Deephaven. The [`time_table`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/how-to-guides/time-table/) method works similarly to [`empty_table`](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/table-operations/create/emptyTable/) in that DQL is used to populate the table with more data. It creates a table with just a `Timestamp` column. The resultant table ticks at a regular interval specified by the input argument.

```python
from deephaven import time_table

ticking_table = time_table("PT1s")
```

The `PT1s` argument is an [ISO-8641 formatted duration string](https://www.digi.com/resources/documentation/digidocs/90001488-13/reference/r_iso_8601_duration_format.htm) that indicates the table will tick once every second.

New ticking tables can be derived from existing ones using DQL, just as in the static case.

```python
new_ticking_table = ticking_table.update_view("TimestampPlusOneSecond = Timestamp + 'PT1s'")
```

This exemplifies Deephaven's use of the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). The table `ticking_table` is a root node in the DAG, and `new_ticking_table` is a downstream node. Because the source table is ticking, the new table is also ticking. Every update to `ticking_table` propagates down the DAG to `new_ticking_table`, and the compute-on-deltas model ensures that only the updated rows are re-evaluated with each update cycle.

## Ingesting static data

Deephaven supports reading from various common file formats like [CSV](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/data-import-export/CSV/readCsv/), [Parquet](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/reference/data-import-export/Parquet/readTable/), and [Arrow](https://deephaven.io/core/pydoc/code/deephaven.arrow.html#module-deephaven.arrow). The following code block reads data from a local CSV file directly into a table. 

```python
from deephaven import read_csv

iris = read_csv("/data/Iris/iris.csv")
```

## Real-world ticking data

Deephaven can ingest tables from other Deephaven workers through [Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier). URIs are sequences of characters that identify different resources on the web. Deephaven's URIs provide the means to receive tables.

The following code block ingests a live table from a Deephaven URI:

```python
from deephaven.uri import resolve

trades_stream_uri = "dh+plain://uri-publisher.uri.svc.cluster.local.:10000/scope/trades_stream"
trades_stream = resolve(trades_stream_uri).tail(5_000).reverse()
```

Data I/O will be explored in more detail later in this crash course.

## Continue the crash course

The next notebook in the crash course, [2a. Table Operations part 1](./2a.%20Table%20Operations%20part%201.md), is the first of two that cover table operations, which are the bread and butter of data manipulation in Deephaven.
